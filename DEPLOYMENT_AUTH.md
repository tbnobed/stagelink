# Virtual Audience Platform v2.0 - Authentication Deployment Guide

## üîê Authentication & URL Shortening Features

Virtual Audience Platform now includes a complete authentication system with URL shortening:

- **User Management**: Admin and user roles with role-based access control
- **Secure Authentication**: Custom username/password authentication with scrypt hashing
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions for scalability
- **Profile Management**: Users can change passwords securely
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can create/delete users and manage platform
- **URL Shortening**: 6-character short links that hide technical parameters from end users
- **Link Security**: Automatic cleanup of expired links with proper error handling
- **Session Tokens**: Single-use tokens prevent history replay attacks and link sharing abuse

## üöÄ Quick Deployment (Production Ready)

### 1. Clone and Configure

```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd virtual-audience-platform
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Edit `.env` and change these important settings:

```bash
# CRITICAL: Change this to a strong, unique secret!
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secure-session-secret-here

# Database password (recommended to change)
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-db-password

# Update database URL with your password
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your-secure-db-password@db:5432/virtual_audience
```

### 3. Deploy with Docker

```bash
# Build and start the application
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Verify deployment
curl http://localhost/health
```

## üîë Default Admin Account

The system creates a default admin account on first startup:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password`

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING**: Change this password immediately after first login!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Data Preservation During Rebuilds

**CRITICAL**: The Docker deployment script has been updated to preserve existing users during rebuilds. However, if you experience data loss:

1. **For Lost Admin User**: Use the `restore-admin-user.sql` script
2. **For Lost User Data**: The updated Docker script now detects existing users and preserves data
3. **Fresh vs Update Deployments**: 
   - Fresh deployments (0 users) = Clean database setup
   - Update deployments (existing users) = Preserve data, update schema only

1. Log in at `http://your-domain/auth`
2. Click your username ‚Üí "Profile"
3. Change password in the profile section

## üîí Session Token Security

Virtual Audience Platform v2.0 includes advanced session token security to prevent link abuse:

### How Session Tokens Work

- **Single-Use Links**: Each streaming link includes a unique session token that can only be used once
- **Replay Attack Prevention**: Used tokens cannot be reused, even if bookmarked or shared
- **Automatic Expiration**: Tokens expire with their parent link or after 24 hours by default
- **Token Validation**: Pages validate tokens before allowing access to streaming features

### Security Benefits

1. **Prevents Link Sharing Abuse**: Links can't be shared indefinitely between users
2. **Stops History Replay**: Bookmarked links become invalid after first use
3. **Controlled Access**: Each session is tracked and monitored
4. **Clean Cleanup**: Expired tokens are automatically removed from the database

### Database Schema Updates

The session token feature adds a new `session_tokens` table with:
- Token ID and expiration tracking
- Foreign key relationships to links and viewer links
- Consumption status to prevent reuse
- User tracking for audit purposes

### For Developers

Session tokens are automatically generated when:
- Creating new streaming links via `/api/links`
- Creating new viewer links via `/api/viewer-links`

Token validation happens at:
- `/api/validate-token` endpoint for token verification
- Session and studio-viewer pages before streaming access

## üë• User Management

### Admin Capabilities
- Access Admin Panel at `/admin`
- Create new users with admin or user roles
- Delete users (except themselves)
- View all user accounts

### User Capabilities
- Access streaming features (Generator, Links, Viewer)
- Change their own password via Profile page
- Create and manage streaming links with expiration settings
- Generate short URLs that hide technical parameters from guests
- Share QR codes for easy access to streaming sessions

## üîí Security Features

### Password Security
- All passwords hashed with **scrypt** algorithm + salt
- No plain text passwords stored anywhere
- Secure password comparison using timing-safe methods

### Session Security
- Sessions stored in PostgreSQL (not memory)
- Configurable session timeout
- Secure HTTP-only cookies
- CSRF protection enabled

### Database Security
- User roles and permissions properly configured
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Indexed queries for performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Change `SESSION_SECRET` to a strong, unique value
- [ ] Update default database password
- [ ] Configure firewall to block direct database access (port 5432)
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS if using custom domain
- [ ] Configure backups for PostgreSQL data

### After Deployment
- [ ] Run `./test-docker-auth.sh` to verify authentication system
- [ ] Access application and verify login works
- [ ] Log in with default admin account (admin/password)
- [ ] Change admin password immediately via Profile page
- [ ] Create regular user accounts via Admin panel
- [ ] Test streaming functionality with authenticated users
- [ ] Verify session persistence across container restarts

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Quick Authentication Test

Run the automated test script:
```bash
./test-docker-auth.sh
```

### Authentication Issues

**Can't log in with admin/password:**
```bash
# Check if admin user was created
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d virtual_audience -c "SELECT username, role FROM users;"

# Check application logs for admin creation
docker-compose logs app | grep -i "admin\|created\|setup"

# Restart containers if admin wasn't created
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

**Session not persisting:**
```bash
# Verify session table exists
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d virtual_audience -c "\dt session"

# Check session secret is set
docker-compose exec app env | grep SESSION_SECRET
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test database connectivity
docker-compose exec app node -e "
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
pool.query('SELECT 1').then(() => console.log('DB OK')).catch(console.error);
"
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Health Checks
- Application health: `http://your-domain/health`
- Database status: Built into Docker health checks
- Authentication status: Try accessing `/` (should redirect to `/auth` if not logged in)

### Logs
```bash
# Application logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Database logs
docker-compose logs -f db

# All services
docker-compose logs -f
```

## üîÑ Updates and Maintenance

### Password Management
- Users can change passwords via Profile page
- Admins should regularly audit user accounts
- Consider implementing password policies if needed

### Session Management
- Sessions automatically expire based on configuration
- Session data stored in PostgreSQL for persistence
- Clean expired sessions automatically handled

### Database Maintenance
- Regular PostgreSQL backups recommended
- Monitor disk usage for session and user data
- Consider user cleanup policies for inactive accounts
- Expired links and short links are automatically cleaned up

## üîó URL Shortening Features

### Short Link Generation
- Automatically generates 6-character alphanumeric codes (excludes confusing characters)
- Format: `/s/abc123` redirects to full streaming URLs
- Hides technical parameters (stream name, return feed, chat settings) from end users

### Link Security
- Expired links are immediately deleted when accessed
- Invalid or deleted links show proper error pages
- No orphaned links remain in the database after cleanup

### User Experience
- Short links display prominently as "recommended" option
- QR codes default to using short links for better scanning
- Copy/share functions prioritize short links for cleaner sharing

## üö® Security Recommendations

1. **Change Default Passwords**: Always change the default admin password
2. **Strong Session Secret**: Use a cryptographically secure session secret
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep the application and dependencies updated
4. **Access Control**: Limit admin accounts to trusted users only
5. **Network Security**: Use firewalls to restrict database access
6. **SSL/TLS**: Enable HTTPS for production deployments
7. **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups of user data and sessions
