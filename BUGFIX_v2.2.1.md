# Critical Bug Fix v2.2.1 - User Deletion Foreign Key Constraint

## Issue Description
Production environment was experiencing foreign key constraint violations when attempting to delete users. The error occurred because the `deleteUser` method was not properly handling the `short_links` table references.

### Error Details
```
Failed to delete user: error: update or delete on table "users" violates foreign key constraint "short_links_created_by_fkey" on table "short_links"
```

The specific issue was that user ID 6 still had references in the `short_links` table, but the deletion logic wasn't updating those references to null before deleting the user.

## Root Cause
The `DatabaseStorage.deleteUser()` method was missing an update operation for the `shortLinks` table. It was properly handling:
- ✅ `generatedLinks` table - setting `createdBy` to null
- ✅ `viewerLinks` table - setting `createdBy` to null  
- ❌ `shortLinks` table - **MISSING** - causing foreign key constraint violation

## Fix Applied

### Code Changes
Updated `server/storage.ts` in the `DatabaseStorage.deleteUser()` method to include:

```typescript
// Set createdBy to null for short links created by this user
await db.update(shortLinks)
  .set({ createdBy: null })
  .where(eq(shortLinks.createdBy, id));
```

### Complete Fix Logic
The updated user deletion now properly handles all foreign key constraints:

1. **Generated Links**: Set `createdBy` to null (preserves links, removes user reference)
2. **Short Links**: Set `createdBy` to null (preserves links, removes user reference) **[NEW]**
3. **Viewer Links**: Set `createdBy` to null (preserves links, removes user reference)
4. **Chat Participants**: Delete associated records
5. **Password Reset Tokens**: Delete associated records
6. **User Record**: Finally delete the user safely

## Docker Updates
- Updated to version 2.2.1 with patch fix
- Updated container names to `virtual-audience-app-v2-2-1` and `virtual-audience-db-v2-2-1`
- Added startup message: "User deletion bug fix applied - handles all foreign key constraints properly"

## Testing
The fix ensures that when a user is deleted:
- All their created links are preserved but the `createdBy` field is set to null
- No foreign key constraint violations occur
- The deletion process completes successfully
- All related data is properly cleaned up

## Impact
- **Critical**: Fixes production user deletion failures
- **Safe**: Preserves all user-created content (links remain functional)
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Database**: No schema changes required, only application logic fix

## Deployment
For existing v2.2 installations, this requires rebuilding the Docker container:

```bash
# Stop existing containers
docker-compose down

# Pull latest code with fix
git pull origin main

# Rebuild and start with v2.2.1
docker-compose up -d --build
```

The fix is immediately effective and resolves the foreign key constraint issue permanently.
