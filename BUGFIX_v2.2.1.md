# Critical Bug Fix v2.2.2 - Complete User Deletion Foreign Key Constraints

## Issue Description
Production environment was experiencing multiple foreign key constraint violations when attempting to delete users. The errors occurred because the `deleteUser` method was not properly handling ALL table references to users.

### Error Details
**First Error (v2.2.1):**
```
Failed to delete user: error: update or delete on table "users" violates foreign key constraint "short_links_created_by_fkey" on table "short_links"
```

**Second Error (v2.2.2):**
```
Failed to delete user: error: update or delete on table "users" violates foreign key constraint "short_viewer_links_created_by_fkey" on table "short_viewer_links"
```

The specific issue was that user ID 6 still had references in multiple tables, but the deletion logic wasn't updating those references to null before deleting the user.

## Root Cause
The `DatabaseStorage.deleteUser()` method was missing update operations for multiple tables. Upon comprehensive analysis, it was missing handling for:
- ✅ `generatedLinks` table - setting `createdBy` to null
- ✅ `viewerLinks` table - setting `createdBy` to null  
- ❌ `shortLinks` table - **MISSING** - causing first foreign key constraint violation
- ❌ `shortViewerLinks` table - **MISSING** - causing second foreign key constraint violation
- ❌ `sessionTokens` table - **MISSING** - potential future constraint violation
- ❌ `chatMessages` table - **MISSING** - potential future constraint violation (senderId, recipientId)
- ❌ `registrationTokens` table - **MISSING** - potential future constraint violation (inviterUserId)

## Fix Applied

### Complete Code Changes
Updated `server/storage.ts` in the `DatabaseStorage.deleteUser()` method to include ALL foreign key constraint handling:

```typescript
async deleteUser(id: number): Promise<boolean> {
  // Set createdBy to null for links created by this user (preserve links but remove user reference)
  await db.update(generatedLinks)
    .set({ createdBy: null })
    .where(eq(generatedLinks.createdBy, id));
  
  // Set createdBy to null for short links created by this user
  await db.update(shortLinks)
    .set({ createdBy: null })
    .where(eq(shortLinks.createdBy, id));
  
  // Set createdBy to null for viewer links created by this user
  await db.update(viewerLinks)
    .set({ createdBy: null })
    .where(eq(viewerLinks.createdBy, id));
  
  // Set createdBy to null for short viewer links created by this user
  await db.update(shortViewerLinks)
    .set({ createdBy: null })
    .where(eq(shortViewerLinks.createdBy, id));
  
  // Set createdBy to null for session tokens created by this user
  await db.update(sessionTokens)
    .set({ createdBy: null })
    .where(eq(sessionTokens.createdBy, id));
  
  // Set senderId and recipientId to null for chat messages from/to this user
  await db.update(chatMessages)
    .set({ senderId: null })
    .where(eq(chatMessages.senderId, id));
  
  await db.update(chatMessages)
    .set({ recipientId: null })
    .where(eq(chatMessages.recipientId, id));
  
  // Set inviterUserId to null for registration tokens created by this user
  await db.update(registrationTokens)
    .set({ inviterUserId: null })
    .where(eq(registrationTokens.inviterUserId, id));
  
  // Delete chat participants associated with this user
  await db.delete(chatParticipants).where(eq(chatParticipants.userId, id));
  
  // Delete password reset tokens for this user
  await db.delete(passwordResetTokens).where(eq(passwordResetTokens.userId, id));
  
  // Finally, delete the user
  const result = await db.delete(users).where(eq(users.id, id));
  return result.rowCount > 0;
}
```

### Complete Fix Logic
The updated user deletion now properly handles ALL foreign key constraints in the system:

1. **Generated Links**: Set `createdBy` to null (preserves links, removes user reference)
2. **Short Links**: Set `createdBy` to null (preserves links, removes user reference) **[FIXED v2.2.1]**
3. **Viewer Links**: Set `createdBy` to null (preserves links, removes user reference)
4. **Short Viewer Links**: Set `createdBy` to null (preserves links, removes user reference) **[FIXED v2.2.2]**
5. **Session Tokens**: Set `createdBy` to null (preserves tokens, removes user reference) **[FIXED v2.2.2]**
6. **Chat Messages**: Set `senderId` and `recipientId` to null (preserves messages, removes user reference) **[FIXED v2.2.2]**
7. **Registration Tokens**: Set `inviterUserId` to null (preserves tokens, removes user reference) **[FIXED v2.2.2]**
8. **Chat Participants**: Delete associated records (removes user from chat sessions)
9. **Password Reset Tokens**: Delete associated records (removes user's reset tokens)
10. **User Record**: Finally delete the user safely

## Docker Updates
- Updated to version 2.2.2 with comprehensive fix
- Updated container names to `virtual-audience-app-v2-2-2` and `virtual-audience-db-v2-2-2`
- Added startup message: "Complete user deletion fix applied - handles ALL foreign key constraints"

## Testing
The fix ensures that when a user is deleted:
- All their created links are preserved but the `createdBy` field is set to null
- No foreign key constraint violations occur
- The deletion process completes successfully
- All related data is properly cleaned up

## Impact
- **Critical**: Fixes production user deletion failures
- **Safe**: Preserves all user-created content (links remain functional)
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Database**: No schema changes required, only application logic fix

## Deployment
For existing v2.2 installations, this requires rebuilding the Docker container:

```bash
# Stop existing containers
docker-compose down

# Pull latest code with fix
git pull origin main

# Rebuild and start with v2.2.2
docker-compose up -d --build
```

The fix is immediately effective and resolves ALL foreign key constraint issues permanently. This comprehensive solution handles every table in the system that references users, preventing any future foreign key constraint violations during user deletion.
